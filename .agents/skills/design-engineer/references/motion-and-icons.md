## Microinteraction Craft Lens

Before adding motion, decide by frequency and purpose:

- High-frequency actions such as command palettes, keyboard shortcuts, repeated row actions, and dense toolbar work should be instant or nearly instant. Do not slow expert workflows with decorative animation.
- Common hover/focus/list interactions should be subtle and short.
- Occasional state changes such as dialogs, drawers, toasts, and page sections can use standard motion when it improves spatial understanding.
- Rare onboarding, demos, and celebratory moments can carry more delight, but only when the product story benefits.
- Valid motion purposes are feedback, state indication, spatial continuity, explanation, and reducing jarring transitions. "Looks cool" is not enough for repeated UI.

Review microinteractions as production details:

- Pressable elements should acknowledge press immediately with a subtle scale, inset, color, or border response.
- Popovers, dropdowns, tooltips, and context menus should animate from their trigger when the primitive exposes a transform-origin variable. Center-origin is reserved for centered modals.
- Avoid entering from `scale(0)`. Start near the final size with opacity so the element feels present before it settles.
- Use transitions for interruptible dynamic UI such as toasts, menus, toggles, and rapidly changing states. Keyframes are better for predetermined ambient loops.
- Gate hover-only motion with `@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine)` so touch devices do not get accidental hover behavior.
- Reduced motion means fewer and gentler movement transitions, not removing every useful opacity/color/focus cue.
- Check motion slowly when it matters: transform origin, timing, color crossfades, stagger, and exit timing are easier to see at reduced speed.

## Motion Review Fixes

Use this table when reviewing or polishing UI motion:

| Issue | Better Direction | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `transition: all` | Transition exact properties such as `transform`, `opacity`, `background-color`, or `border-color`. | Exact transitions avoid accidental layout work and make timing intentional. |
| Entry starts at `scale(0)` | Start near final size, such as `scale(0.95)` with opacity. | Elements should feel like they settle into place, not appear from nowhere. |
| UI uses `ease-in` | Use `ease-out` for entrances/feedback or `ease-in-out` for movement between two visible states. | Immediate motion feels more responsive. |
| Popover scales from center | Use the primitive's trigger-origin variable when available. | Anchored surfaces should visually come from the control that opened them. |
| Keyboard action animates open/close | Make it instant or nearly instant. | Expert flows should not wait on decorative timing. |
| Common UI transition exceeds 300ms | Bring it into the 120-250ms range unless it explains something. | Slow repeated motion makes the product feel slower. |
| Hover motion applies on touch | Gate hover effects with `@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine)`. | Touch devices should not get accidental hover behavior. |
| Rapidly changing UI uses keyframes | Prefer transitions or spring/WAAPI behavior that can be interrupted. | Dynamic UI should retarget smoothly when users act quickly. |
| Exit uses the same timing as entrance | Make exit/release faster than enter/hold. | The system should respond quickly after the user's decision. |

## Motion Vocabulary To Use In Decisions

Name motion precisely in plans and code comments:

- Entrances/exits: fade, slide, scale, pop, reveal.
- Sequencing: keyframes, tween/interpolation, stagger, orchestration, delay, duration, fill mode, stepped animation.
- Movement/transforms: translate, scale, rotate, skew, 3D tilt/flip, perspective, transform origin, origin-aware animation.
- State transitions: crossfade, continuity transition, morph, shared element transition, layout animation, accordion/collapse, direction-aware transition.
- Scroll: scroll reveal, scroll-driven animation, parallax, page transition, view transition.
- Feedback: hover, press/tap, hold-to-confirm, drag, drag-to-reorder, swipe-to-dismiss, rubber-banding, shake/wiggle, ripple.
- Easing: ease-out for most user-triggered UI, ease-in-out for ambient loops, spring/bounce only when physicality is intentional.

## Timing Defaults

Start with these and tune by feel:

- Hover/focus: 120-180ms.
- Press/tap: 80-140ms.
- Tooltip/popover/menu entrance: 140-220ms.
- Drawer/dialog entrance: 180-280ms.
- Page/section transition: 240-450ms.
- Ambient loops: 2-12s, low opacity, no layout shift.
- Loading indicators: 0.8-1.8s loop for spinners; slower for ambient "thinking" states.
- Repeated UI interactions should usually stay below 300ms; expert workflows often need no entrance/exit animation at all.
- Use faster exit/release timing than enter/hold timing when the user has already made a decision.

Always respect `prefers-reduced-motion`. In CSS, provide a reduced-motion override. In JS animation libraries, disable or simplify nonessential motion.

## Motion Library Callout

Use Motion for animation-influenced sites when movement is part of the product experience:

- Product demos that need staged reveal, continuity, or shared element transitions.
- App shells with layout animation, route transitions, expandable panels, drawers, or inspector surfaces.
- Interactive surfaces with drag/reorder, press/tap feedback, gestures, or scroll-linked effects.
- Technical sites with animated code modules, data-flow diagrams, integration maps, or feature walkthroughs.
- Rich marketing/product pages where animation supports hierarchy and comprehension.

Do not add Motion just for one fade, hover color, or spinner. Use CSS/Tailwind for small state transitions. Prefer GSAP for timeline-heavy choreography, and Three.js/R3F for true 3D or shader scenes. Keep Motion components small, interruptible, transform/opacity-first, and reduced-motion aware.

## Loader And Status Selection

Use `icons.icantcode.fyi` loaders when the UI needs a compact, quiet, technical loading/status mark. Copy the chosen SVG from the source site or repo into the component or an asset file only when needed.

Recommended mapping:

- Blocking spinner: Loading, Spiral, Orbit, Comet, Quartet.
- Determinate/progress metaphor: Pyramid, Compile, Dock, Bar, Ladder, Aperture.
- AI/agent/retrieval state: Thinking, Stream, Caret, Cipher, Handshake, Listening, Relay.
- Success/final status: Verify.
- Stop/error/denied: Halt, Plus X, Beacon with error styling.
- Waiting/heartbeat/watch mode: Heartbeat, Beacon, Ring Pulse.
- Ambient background detail: Wave, Breath, Sparkle, Glider, Lattice, Inner Twinkle.

Keep loaders small, subdued, and semantically labeled. Do not replace real progress, error text, or retry controls with decorative animation.

## Icon Policy

- Prefer the repo's existing icon system.
- If `lucide-react` is installed, use lucide as the default icon set for common UI actions and product objects: search, copy, settings, external link, refresh, user, users, database, calendar, menu, close, check, warning, info, lock, key, mail, chart, file, terminal, command, arrow, and theme toggles.
- Import named lucide icons directly from `lucide-react`; avoid hand-drawing SVGs when lucide already has the symbol.
- Match lucide `size`, `strokeWidth`, opacity, and alignment within each toolbar, nav item, table row, or button group.
- Use custom pixel SVG icons only when the product already uses a pixel/block language or the icon needs to match a technical studio-style geometry.
- Use Pixel Icon Library when a consistent pixelated icon set is desired; keep the set visually separate from lucide action icons unless the whole product intentionally uses pixel geometry.
- Use Iconify icon sets when lucide is not enough, when the UI needs a different stroke/fill family, or when browsing multiple variants is useful. Check the set license, grid size, palette, and visual weight before adopting it.
- Prefer one Iconify family per surface. Do not mix Tabler, Material, Phosphor, Carbon, HeroIcons, Remix, IconPark, and other families in the same toolbar unless the product intentionally has a mixed icon language.
- Iconify is especially useful for programming/file icons, brand-adjacent sets, flags/maps, spinners, multicolor icons, and alternate filled/outline/two-tone variants.
- Use `simple-icons` for brand logos when installed and appropriate.
- Icon-only buttons need accessible labels or tooltips.
- Match stroke width, optical size, and alignment across a toolbar.

## Implementation Notes

- Prefer CSS transitions/keyframes for simple hover, reveal, loader, and theme transitions.
- Prefer Motion when the task needs layout animation, shared element transitions, drag/reorder, gestures, scroll-linked effects, or orchestrated entrances.
- If a repo still uses Framer Motion, extend it rather than migrating packages during a design pass unless the user asks.
- Prefer GSAP only when already installed and the interaction needs timeline-level control.
- Use Three.js only when a real 3D scene is part of the product value; verify canvas rendering visually.
- Avoid animating layout-heavy properties when transform/opacity will do.
- Keep animated backgrounds behind content with clear pointer-events and z-index rules.
- Make animated elements nonblocking: the UI should remain usable if animation fails.
